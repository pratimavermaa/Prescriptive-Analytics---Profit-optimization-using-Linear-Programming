Profit optimization of a manufacturing division of a premier Aircraft manufacturing company using Linear programing Modelling using MS Excel- Open Solver
**Problem Statement**
One of a manufacturing division of a premier air craft manufacturing company makes 
Fuel injection pump for supplying fuel to the engine combustion chamber.
The division deals in two types of businesses WRT pumps.
(1)repair and overhaul I.e ROH of pumps which usually come after completing the required flying hrs.

The total man hour planned for these three type of works are as follows:-
1. Detail manufacturing =6000 hrs
2. Sub assembly mfg = 2500 hrs
3. Assembly mfging = 1500 hrs.
4. For CAT D units subassembly & assembly hrs required per unit is 100 hrs each.
5. And for CAT A units work distribution is as follows :-
Detail part manufacturing =300 hrs,
Subassembly manufacturing =200 hrs,
Assembly manufacturing = 100 hrs.
As per finance department report 19-20,
the profit per unit in CAT D units is 4000 INR and 6000 in CAT A units.
What units from both category a production manager should take for maximising profit.
